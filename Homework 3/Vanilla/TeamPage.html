        4th Year, Computer Science BS/MS
        Hi! I love web design and front-end design. I'm also interested in UX/UI, specifically in terms
        of mobile applications. I often drink boba, perhaps too often.

        <h3>Minh Vu</h3>
        5th Year, Computer Science BS. I switched to Computer Science at the end of my sophmore year
        because I wanted to be hands-on with the the materials that I was learning, and I figured that
        Computer Science is a great major to achieve that. My focus is on back-end, but I also wish to 
        learn a lot more about front-end so that I can become a full-stack developer in the future.
        Particularly, I love being a software engineer because there is always something new to learn,
        which helps because I get burned out easily.
