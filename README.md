Welcome to the Memento Github directory!


Introduction:
  This directory contains folders of the weekly progress on Memento. The initial weeks mostly comprised of abstract and higher-level implementation, whereas the later weeks consisted on programming the details and functionality. 

Idea:
  The main goal for our app is to help user's easily document their memories. What we want to create is in essence a virtual photo album. During our initial need-finding stage, we came to the conclusion that there was online service that allowed users to document their travels. Given the increasing mobile nature of society, we realized that physical photoalbums were items of the past. With Memento, we aim to provide a way for people to be able to document their memories on the go!
